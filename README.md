# Plot Area
This is the test harness for the Plot Area canvas class.
I wanted to create a public Xojo Project to share with the Forum in the hopes it might grow into something
the community might help evolve into something a little more useful.

The current module does three types of graphs,  Bar, Line and Scatter.
These currently work.
I wanted to see what the community would do with such a project and improve my git skills in the process.
